I decided to make an advanced #ReactNative animation video tutorial this time. This is an animated carousel / animated slider with lots of animations going on.

In this video tutorial we'll learn how to create:

- text parallax effect
- pagination animation
- clipper/ticker animation with translateY
- circle animation based on active slide index

Built using @expo, vanilla React Native Animated API and FlatList.
This code works in plain React Native project as well since we are using only React Native APIs such as Animated and FlatList.

In this video tutorial we'll learn how to create an accordion animation in React Native using Transition API from React Native Reanimated library (https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) and flexbox styling.
We will re-create an awesome and colourful animation done by InterfaceMarket.
